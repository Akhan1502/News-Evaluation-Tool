## About the Project  
The **News Evaluation Tool (NET)** is an AI-powered plugin designed to assess the credibility of online news sources. It analyzes website content, cross-references multiple sources, and provides reliability scores to help users make informed decisions. This tool aims to combat misinformation by offering a transparent and data-driven approach to news evaluation.  

## How It Works  
1. **Text Analysis** – The plugin scans the text on a webpage and identifies key statements, facts, and opinions.  
2. **Source Comparison** – Using AI, the tool searches for similar or opposing viewpoints from reliable sources.  
3. **Information Presentation** – The results are displayed in two columns:  
   - **Left:** Original content from the selected webpage.  
   - **Right:** Alternative perspectives or corroborating facts from verified sources.  
4. **Credibility Scoring** – The plugin assigns a reliability rating (High, Medium, or Low) to each source based on its credibility.  

## Project Development  
This project was developed by **Team Forty-Two** as part of the **AI Media Hackathon 2025**. The tool was designed to support journalists, researchers, and everyday users in evaluating news credibility and reducing the spread of misinformation.
